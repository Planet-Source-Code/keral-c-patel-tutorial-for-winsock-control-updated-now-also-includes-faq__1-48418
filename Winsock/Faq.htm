  <p align="left">Q. What is this TCP/IP I have heard a lot about it?---<font color="#008000">(By 
    Abhishek.Net)</font></p>
  <p align="left">A. TCP/IP refers to two network protocols (or methods of data 
    transport) used on the Internet. They are Transmission Control Protocol and 
    Internet Protocol, respectively. These network protocols belong to a larger 
    collection of protocols, or a protocol suite. These are collectively referred 
    to as the TCP/IP suite. Protocols within the TCP/IP suite work together to 
    provide data transport on the Internet. In other words, these protocols provide 
    nearly all services available to today's Net surfer. Some of those services 
    include Transmission of electronic mail, File transfers, Usenet news delivery 
    and Access to the World Wide Web. I think that most platforms supports TCP/IP. 
    Some of them are DOS, UNIX, Windows, Macintosh and OS2.</p>
  <p align="left">Q. Why should I specify &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; as my IP for testing 
    this code on my PC?---<font color="#008000">(By Vrutant7287)</font></p>
  <p align="left">A. This is also a detailed subject that why should we specify 
    &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; as our IP when testing something locally. You can specify 
    different IP and connect to that PC if you have proper settings. E.g.:- You 
    have a networked environment and say there are three PC's, PC1, PC2 and PC3. 
    You are on PC1 and you want to get connected with PC2 or PC3 then you can 
    specify the IP of PC2 or PC3 you will have a successful connection only if 
    there is another part of you application running over there and You have set 
    it up to listen for connections on specific ports on that PC. For testing 
    or running the application locally (On standalone PC) you have to specify 
    &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; as IP. One More trick You can even specify the name 
    of your computer as IP. It will work.</p>
  <p align="left">Q. Why Specific Port and Please tell me more about Ports.---<font color="#008000">(By 
    SuperCoder77)</font></p>
  <p align="left">A. Here we will discuss this point with an example. I think 
    it will make it easier for everybody to understand. Say For example on our 
    server side there is an application with a Winsock Control. In the Form Load 
    or any similar event we are initializing our server-side winsock control to 
    Listen on specific port by its Listen Method. If we don't specify Port number 
    then our application will get confused and it will get data which is not meant 
    for it. It can cause many errors. That's why use specific port for data transactions. 
    Ports are the virtual gateways for communication with other objects. I cannot 
    cover all the things about ports over here It is out of the scope of this 
    tutorial.</p>
  <p align="left">Q. What is sckClosed?---<font color="#008000">(By Jack)</font></p>
  <p align="left">A. It is a predefined Constant for the state of the winsock 
    control. If sckClosed is True then our Winsock Socket is closed. And I would 
    also like to explain about requestID. The line after checking the state of 
    our Winsock Control. In this line of code Whenever a Client tries to connect 
    with the Server on the Port on which Server is listening then Server-side 
    Winsock's Connection Request event fires. Here we check about the State of 
    our control and fix it if necessary. Then we accept the request from the client 
    and thus a connection is established between the Client and Server through 
    which data can be transferred.</p>
  <p align="left">Q. I wanted to know that will GetData Method get whole string 
    into the variable that has been passed to it as an argument in the parameter?---<font color="#008000">(By 
    Emily Gratell)</font></p>
  <p align="left">A. Yeah. When Ever Winsock Control Gets any data its Data Arrival 
    event will fire. This is where we put our Code. First we declare a variable 
    and when we pass that variable in the parameter of the GetData method of our 
    Winsock Control it will get all the data that was sent from the Other-side 
    on that specific Port.</p>
  <p align="left">Q. What are the uses of Winsock Control and If I learn this 
    will it benefit me?---<font color="#008000">(By Ronny Ronson)</font></p>
  <p align="left">A. It is used in Client-Server environments. It is used in the 
    utilities for Banks and Hospitals and bigger Corporations where there is a 
    centralized server and all the other Workstations are connected to it. Now 
    It depends on you that what benefit it will do. If you are thinking about 
    making Softwares for firms and banks and places where Client-Server Interface 
    is needed then you will surely benefit from this. This Tutorial doesn't explains 
    everything in detail but then also it will get you started. I had read somewhere 
    that whatever happens to the Software market a programmer who knows how to 
    implement Client-Server Interface will never suffer.</p>
  <p align="left">Q. Can I make a torjan from this? Will it execute whatever command 
    I send to it?---<font color="#008000">(By Arpan.Mehta)</font></p>
  <p align="left">A. I was not going to post this online but I am getting many 
    emails for this. Networking is a very powerful technology and if its knowledge 
    goes into wrong hands then, he or she can create a havoc by using it for illegal 
    purposes. I personally don't recommend it. I don't believe in destruction 
    I believe in creation. My advice is to be creative. Now the answer to this 
    question is that you can surely make a trojan from it. But be sure that where 
    ever your trojan goes it will need VB runtime Files if you make it in VB. 
    This is just one idea, you will get many bigger ideas as you go further in 
    this subject of TCP and networking and unleash its power.</p>

    </font>I am very pleased that people have came out with questions. I am getting 
    more and more questions everyday so I thought that It would be better if I 
    would provide a small FAQ on this. If your question is not listed over here 
    and you have something different then please Email me at <u>keral82@keral.com</u> 
    I will try my best to answer your questions. Regards. <u><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="#0080C0">Keral.</font></b></u></p>
